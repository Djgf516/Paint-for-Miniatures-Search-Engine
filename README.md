* Migrated an HTML database to PostgreSQL utilizes over 1000 paints and 3000 paint matches to bring you the paint colors you need
* Robust search webpage you can search by:
  * color name
  * brand
  * hexcolor code
* Uses match values to display similar colors based on the International Commision on Illumination's distance metric Î”E or Delta E (calculations and values thanks to Redgrim) 
* Paints which have been compared will be displayed with like colors when the checkbox is selected.
* A green background represents a very close match to the searched paint, nearly visually indistinguishable.(A delta of less than 3)
* A yellow background is usually pretty close match to the searched paint and can safely be used as a substitute. (A delta of less than 7)
